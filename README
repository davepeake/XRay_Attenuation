Two programs with calculate attenuation lengths of various materials using NIST data.
And when I say it uses NIST data, it actually scrapes the data from the NIST XCom database with every update so it will need internet access to work.

The densities for all elements are held in densities.dat, a pickle file using densities I found ages ago, so if you're using it for precision work you might want to check they're accurate enough for you.
